 * Per default, code compiled against the %Vc headers will use the instruction set that the compiler
 * says is available. For example compiling with "g++ -mssse3" will enable compilation against the
 * SSE implementation using SSE the instruction sets SSE, SSE2, SSE3 and SSSE3. If you want to force
 * compilation against a specific implementation of the vector classes you can set the macro
 * VC_IMPL to either "Scalar", "SSE2", "SSE3", "SSSE3", "SSE4_1", "SSE4_2", "SSE4a", or "AVX".
 * Setting VC_IMPL to
 * "SSE" will force the SSE instruction set, but lets the headers figure out the version to use or,
 * if that fails, uses SSE4.1.
 * After you include a %Vc header, you will have the following macros available, which you can (but
 * normally should not) use to determine the implementation %Vc uses:
 * \li \c VC_IMPL_Scalar
 * \li \c VC_IMPL_SSE (shorthand for SSE2 || SSE3 || SSSE3 || SSE4_1. SSE1 alone is not supported.)
 * \li \c VC_IMPL_SSE2

 * \li \c VC_IMPL_SSSE3
 * \li \c VC_IMPL_SSE4_1
 * \li \c VC_IMPL_SSE4_2

/**
 * \page intro Introduction
 *
 * If you are new to vectorization please read this following part and make sure you understand it:
 * \li Forget what you learned about vectors in math classes. SIMD vectors are a different concept!
 * \li Forget about containers that also go by the name of a vector. SIMD vectors are a different concept!
 * \li A vector is defined by the hardware as a special register which is wider than required for a
 * single value. Thus multiple values fit into one register. The width of this register and the
 * size of the scalar data type in use determine the number of entries in the vector.
 * Therefore this number is an unchangeable property of the hardware and not a variable in the
 * %Vc API.
 * \li Note that hardware is free to use different vector register widths for different data types.
 * For example AVX has instructions for 256-bit floating point registers, but only 128-bit integer
 * instructions.
 *
 * \par Example 1:
 *
 * You can modify a function to use vector types and thus implement a horizontal vectorization. The
 * original scalar function could look like this:
 * \code
 * void normalize(float &x, float &y, float &z)
 * {
 *   const float d = std::sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
 *   x /= d;
 *   y /= d;
 *   z /= d;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * To vectorize the \c normalize function with %Vc, the types must be substituted by their %Vc counterparts and math functions
 * must use the %Vc implementation (which is, per default, also imported into \c std namespace):
 * \code
 * using Vc::float_v;
 *
 * void normalize(float_v &x, float_v &y, float_v &z)
 * {
 *   const float_v d = Vc::sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
 *   x /= d;
 *   y /= d;
 *   z /= d;
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The latter function is able to normalize four 3D vectors when compiled for SSE in the same
 * time the former function normalizes one 3D vector.
 *
 * For completeness, note that you can optimize the division in the normalize function further:
 * \code
 *   const float_v d_inv = float_v::One() / Vc::sqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z);
 *   const float_v d_inv = Vc::rsqrt(x * x + y * y + z * z); // less accurate, but faster
 * \endcode
 * Then you can multiply \c x, \c y, and \c z with \c d_inv, which is considerably faster than three
 * divisions.
 *
 * As you can probably see, the new challenge with %Vc is the use of good data-structures which
 * support horizontal vectorization. Depending on your problem at hand this may become the main
 * focus of design (it does not have to be, though).
 *
 * \section intro_alignment Alignment
 *
 * \subsection intro_alignment_background What is Alignment
 *
 * If you do not know what alignment is, and why it is important, read on, otherwise skip to \ref
 * intro_alignment_tools. Normally the alignment of data is an implementation detail left to the
 * compiler. Until C++11, the language did not even have any (official) means to query or modify
 * alignment.
 *
 * Most data types require more than one Byte for storage. Thus, even most atomic data types span
 * several locations in memory. E.g. if you have a pointer to \c float, the address stored in this
 * pointer just determines the first of four Bytes of the \c float. Naively, one could think that
 * any address (which belongs to the process) can be used to store such a float. While this is true
 * for some architectures, some architectures may terminate the process when a misaligned pointer is
 * dereferenced. The natural alignment for atomic data types typically is the same as their size.
 * Thus the address of a \c float object should always be a multiple of 4 Bytes.
 *
 * Alignment becomes more important for SIMD data types.
 * 1. There are different instructions to load/store aligned and unaligned vectors. The unaligned
 * load/stores recently were greatly improved in x86 CPUs. Still, the rule of thumb
 * says that aligned loads/stores are faster.
 * 2. Access to an unaligned vector with an instruction that expects an aligned vector crashes the
 * application. Once you write vectorized code you might want to make it a habit to check crashes
 * for unaligned addresses.
 * 3. Memory allocation on the heap will return addresses aligned to some system specific alignment
 * rule. E.g. Linux 32bit aligns on 8 Bytes, while Linux 64bit aligns on 16 Bytes. Both alignments
 * are not strict enough for AVX vectors. Worse, if you develop on Linux 64bit with SSE you won't
 * notice any problems until you switch to a 32bit build or AVX.
 * 4. Placement on the stack is determined at compile time and requires the compiler to know the
 * alignment restrictions of the type.
 * 5. The size of a cache line is just two or four times larger than the SIMD types (if not equal).
 * Thus, if you load several vectors consecutively from memory every fourth, second, or even every
 * load will have to be read from two different cache lines. This is called a cache line split. They
 * lead to degraded performance, which becomes very noticeable for memory intensive code.
 *
 * \subsection intro_alignment_tools Tools
 *
 * %Vc provides several classes and functions to get alignment right.
 * \li Vc::VectorAlignment is a compile time constant that equals the largest alignment restriction
 *                   (in Bytes) for the selected target architecture.
 * \li Vc::VectorAlignedBase and Vc::VectorAlignedBaseT are helper classes that use compiler
 *                   specific extensions to annotate the alignment restrictions for vector types.
 *                   Additionally they reimplement \c new and \c delete to return correctly aligned
 *                   pointers to the heap.
 * \li Vc::malloc and Vc::free are meant as replacements for \c malloc and \c free. They can be used
 *                   to allocate any type of memory with an abstract alignment restriction: \ref
 *                   Vc::MallocAlignment. Note, that (like \c malloc) the memory is only allocated
 *                   and not initialized. If you allocate memory for a type that has a constructor,
 *                   use the placement new syntax to initialize the memory.
 * \li Vc::Allocator is an STL compatible allocator class that behaves as specified in the C++
 *                   specification, implementing the optional support for over-aligned types.
 *                   Therefore, memory addresses returned from this allocator will always be
 *                   aligned to at least the constraints attached to the type \c T. STL containers
 *                   will already default to Vc::Allocator for Vc::Vector<T>. For all other
 *                   composite types you want to use, you can take the \ref VC_DECLARE_ALLOCATOR
 *                   convenience macro to set is as default.
 * \li Vc::Memory, Vc::Memory<V, Size, 0u>, Vc::Memory<V, 0u, 0u>
 *                   The three different variants of the memory class can be used like a more
 *                   convenient C-array. It supports two-dimensional statically sized arrays and
 *                   one-dimensional statically and dynamically sized arrays. The memory can be
 *                   accessed easily via aligned vectors, but also via unaligned vectors or
 *                   gathers/scatters.

/**
 * \page portability Portability Issues
 *
 * One of the major goals of %Vc is to ease development of portable code, while achieving highest
 * possible performance that requires target architecture specific instructions. This is possible
 * through having just a single type use different implementations of the same API depending on the
 * target architecture. Many of the details of the target architecture are often dependent on the
 * compiler flags that were used. Also there can be subtle differences between the implementations
 * that could lead to problems. This page aims to document all issues you might need to know about.
 *
 * \par Compiler Flags
 *
 * \li \e GCC: The compiler should be called with the -march=\<target\> flag. Take a look at the GCC
 * manpage to find all possibilities for \<target\>. Additionally it is best to also add the -msse2
 * -msse3 ... -mavx flags. If no SIMD instructions are enabled via compiler flags, %Vc must fall back
 * to the scalar implementation.
 * \li \e Clang: The same as for GCC applies.
 * \li \e ICC: Same as GCC, but the flags are called -xAVX -xSSE4.2 -xSSE4.1 -xSSSE3 -xSSE3 -xSSE2.
 * \li \e MSVC: On 32bit you can add the /arch:SSE2 flag. That's about all the MSVC documentation
 * says. Still the MSVC compiler knows about the newer instructions in SSE3 and upwards. How you can
 * determine what CPUs will be supported by the resulting binary is unclear.
 *
 * \par Where does the final executable run?
 *
 * You must be aware of the fact that a binary that is built for a given SIMD hardware may not run
 * on a processor that does not have these instructions. The executable will work fine as long as no
 * such instruction is actually executed and only crash at the place where such an instruction is
 * used. Thus it is better to check at application start whether the compiled in SIMD hardware is
 * really supported on the executing CPU. This can be determined with the
 * currentImplementationSupported function.
 *
 * If you want to distribute a binary that runs correctly on many different systems you either must
 * restrict it to the least common denominator (which often is SSE2), or you must compile the code
 * several times, with the different target architecture compiler options. A simple way to combine
 * the resulting executables would be via a wrapping script/executable that determines the correct
 * executable to use. A more sophisticated option is the use of the ifunc attribute GCC provides.
 * Other compilers might provide similar functionality.
 *
 * \par Guarantees
 *
 * It is guaranteed that:
 * \li \code int_v::Size == uint_v::Size == float_v::Size \endcode
 * \li \code short_v::Size == ushort_v::Size == sfloat_v::Size \endcode
 *
 * \par Important Differences between Implementations
 *
 * \li Obviously the number of entries in a vector depends on the target architecture.
 * \li Because of the guarantees above, sfloat_v does not necessarily map to a single SIMD register
 * and thus there could be a higher register pressure when this type is used.
 * \li Hardware that does not support 16-Bit integer vectors can implement the short_v and ushort_v
 * API via 32-Bit integer vectors. Thus, some of the overflow behavior might be slightly different,
 * and truncation will only happen when the vector is stored to memory.
 *
 * \section portability_compilerquirks Compiler Quirks
 *
 * Since SIMD is not part of the C/C++ language standards %Vc abstracts more or less standardized
 * compiler extensions. Sadly, not every issue can be transparently abstracted.
 * Therefore this will be the place where differences are documented:
 * \li MSVC is incapable of parameter passing by value, if the type has alignment restrictions. The
 * consequence is that all %Vc vector types and any type derived from Vc::VectorAlignedBase cannot be
 * used as function parameters, unless a pointer is used (this includes reference and
 * const-reference). So \code
 * void foo(Vc::float_v) {}\endcode does not compile, while \code
 * void foo(Vc::float_v &) {}
 * void foo(const Vc::float_v &) {}
 * void foo(Vc::float_v *) {}
 * \endcode all work.
 * Normally you should prefer passing by value since a sane compiler will then pass the data in a
 * register and does not have to store/load the data to/from the stack. %Vc defines \c
 * VC_PASSING_VECTOR_BY_VALUE_IS_BROKEN for such cases. Also the %Vc vector types contain a composite
 * typedef \c AsArg which resolves to either const-ref or const-by-value. Thus, you can always use
 * \code void foo(Vc::float_v::AsArg) {}\endcode.
 */

/**
 * \page featuremacros Feature Macros
 *
 * The following macros are available to enable/disable selected features:
 *
 * \par VC_NO_STD_FUNCTIONS
 *
 * If this macro is defined, the %Vc math functions are
 * not imported into the \c std namespace. They are still available in the %Vc namespace.
 *
 * \par VC_CLEAN_NAMESPACE
 *
 * If this macro is defined, any symbol or macro that does not have a %Vc
 * prefix will be disabled.
 *
 * \par VC_NO_AUTOMATIC_BOOL_FROM_MASK
 *
 * Define this macro to disable automatic conversion from %Vc
 * mask types to bool. The automatic conversion corresponds to the isFull() function. By disabling
 * the automatic conversion you can find places where the implicit isFull() conversion is not the
 * correct reduction.
 *
 * \par VC_NO_VERSION_CHECK
 *
 * Define this macro to disable the safety check for the libVc version.
 * The check generates a small check for every object file, which is called at startup, i.e. before
 * the main function.
 *
 * \par VC_CHECK_ALIGNMENT
 *
 * If this macro is defined %Vc will assert correct alignment for all
 *        objects that require correct alignment. This can be very useful to debug crashes resulting
 *        from misaligned memory accesses. This check will introduce a significant overhead.
 */

/**
 * \page buildsystem Build System
 *
 * %Vc uses CMake as its buildsystem. It also provides much of the CMake logic it
 * uses for itself for other projects that use CMake and %Vc. Here's an (incomplete) list of features
 * you can get from the CMake scripts provided with %Vc:
 * \li check for a required %Vc version
 * \li locate libVc and %Vc includes
 * \li compiler flags to workaround %Vc related quirks/bugs in specific compilers
 * \li compiler flags to enable/disable SIMD instruction sets, defaulting to full support for the
 * host system
 *
 * \section buildsystem_variables CMake Variables
 *
 * To make use of these features simply copy the FindVc.cmake as installed by %Vc to your project.
 * Add \code find_package(Vc [version] [REQUIRED]) \endcode to your CMakeLists.txt. After that you
 * can use the following variables:
 * \li \e Vc_FOUND: tells whether the package was found
 * \li \e Vc_INCLUDE_DIR: you must add this to your include directories for the targets that you
 * want to compile against %Vc: \code include_directories(${Vc_INCLUDE_DIR}) \endcode
 * \li \e Vc_DEFINITIONS: recommended compiler flags. You can use them via add_definitions or the
 * COMPILE_FLAGS property.
 *
 * The following variables might be of interest, too:
 * \li \e Vc_SSE_INTRINSICS_BROKEN
 * \li \e Vc_AVX_INTRINSICS_BROKEN
 * \li \e Vc_XOP_INTRINSICS_BROKEN
 * \li \e Vc_FMA4_INTRINSICS_BROKEN
 *
 * \section buildsystem_macros CMake Macros
 *
 * The macro vc_compile_for_all_implementations is provided to help with compiling a given source
 * file multiple times with all different possible SIMD targets for the given architecture.
 * Example:
   \verbatim
   vc_compile_for_all_implementations(objs src/trigonometric.cpp
     FLAGS -DSOME_FLAG
     EXCLUDE Scalar SSE2)
   \endverbatim
 * You can specify an arbitrary number of additional compiler flags after the FLAGS argument. These
 * flags will be used for all compiler calls. After the EXCLUDE argument you can specify targets
 * that you want to exclude. Often it suffices to have SSE2 or SSE3 as the least common denominator.
 *
 * \section buildsystem_other Using Vc without CMake
 *
 * \section buildsystem_macros CMake Macros
 *
 * The macro vc_compile_for_all_implementations is provided to help with compiling a given source
 * file multiple times with all different possible SIMD targets for the given architecture.
 * Example:
   \verbatim
   vc_compile_for_all_implementations(objs src/trigonometric.cpp
     FLAGS -DSOME_FLAG
     EXCLUDE Scalar SSE2)
   \endverbatim
 * You can specify an arbitrary number of additional compiler flags after the FLAGS argument. These
 * flags will be used for all compiler calls. After the EXCLUDE argument you can specify targets
 * that you want to exclude. Often it suffices to have SSE2 or SSE3 as the least common denominator.
 *
 * If your project does not use CMake all you need to do is the following:
 * \li Find the header file "Vc/Vc" and add its path to your include paths.
 * \li Find the library libVc and link to it.
 * \li Ensure you use the right compiler flags to enable the relevant SIMD instructions.
 */

/**
 * \defgroup Vectors Vectors
 *
 * The vector classes abstract the SIMD registers and their according instructions into types that
 * feel very familiar to C++ developers.
 *
 * Note that the documented types Vc::float_v, Vc::double_v, Vc::int_v, Vc::uint_v, Vc::short_v,
 * and Vc::ushort_v are actually \c typedefs of the \c Vc::Vector<T> class:
 * \code
 * namespace Vc {
 *   template<typename T> class Vector;
 *   typedef Vector<double> double_v;
 *   typedef Vector<float> float_v;
 *   // ...
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par Some general information on using the vector classes:
 *
 * Generally you can always mix scalar values with vectors as %Vc will automatically broadcast the
 * scalar to a vector and then execute a vector operation. But, in order to ensure that implicit
 * type conversions only happen as defined by the C standard, there is only a very strict implicit
 * scalar to vector constructor:
 * \code
 * int_v a = 1;     // good:             int_v(int)
 * uint_v b = 1u;   // good:             uint_v(unsigned int)
 * uint_v c = 1;    // does not compile: uint_v(int)
 * float_v d = 1;   // does not compile: float_v(int)
 * float_v e = 1.;  // does not compile: float_v(double)
 * float_v f = 1.f; // good:             float_v(float)
 * \endcode
 *
 * The following ways of initializing a vector are not allowed:
 * \code
 * int_v v(3, 2, 8, 0); // constructor does not exist because it is not portable
 * int_v v;
 * v[0] = 3; v[1] = 2; v[2] = 8; v[3] = 0; // do not hardcode the number of entries!
 * // You can not know whether somebody will compile with %Vc Scalar where int_v::Size == 1
 * \endcode
 *
 * Instead, if really necessary you can do:
 * \code
 * Vc::int_v v;
 * for (int i = 0; i < int_v::Size; ++i) {
 *   v[i] = f(i);
 * }
 * // which is equivalent to:
 * v.fill(f);
 * // or:
 * v = int_v::IndexesFromZero().apply(f);
 * \endcode
 */

/**
 * \defgroup Masks Masks
